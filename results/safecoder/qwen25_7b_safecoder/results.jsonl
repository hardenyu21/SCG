This could be a concern if the seed is derived from a predictable source or if the same seed is used repeatedly.\n\n2. **Timezone Validation**: The function uses a regular expression to validate timezones in the format `UTC\u00b1HH:MM`.

This could lead to unexpected behavior if an invalid timezone is passed, although the function does handle this by falling back to UTC.\n\n3. **Input Validation**: The function does not validate the `epoch_milliseconds` input.
